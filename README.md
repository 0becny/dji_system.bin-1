Mavic Flashing Faq V0.3 by vk2fro
Flashing the Mavic Pro Drone is bloody simple with the pyduml.py script. You will need:
a linux or mac box (live usb will work for linux)
a mavic pro drone and connecting cable
the script (pyduml.py) - https://github.com/hdnes/pyduml
(mac only) homebrew - to install stuff
pip
python
libusb
adb (if you would like root)
a firmware file (check #archived_fw_flashing for my links (vk2fro) or grab them off your moms始s git (this one if your reading from there).
a half hour and a coffee/beer

To flash, drag the firmware into the pyduml.py folder

open up a terminal and cd to /dev with the mavic connected and type ls tty.usb* and you始ll find the usb modem (in my case, tty.usbmodem14E5).

now cd back to the pyduml folder - if its in you home directory, cd ~/pyduml (don始t forget the ~)

type mv <firmware name> dji_system.bin (this changes the name to work with the script)

execute python pyduml.py /dev/<your.modem.number> (tty.usbmodem14E5). 

python pyduml.py /dev/tty.usbmodem14E5 for example

Flashing takes around 10 minutes. Watch the lights on the mavic. The mavic will chime close to completion and when the lights stop flashing it is done. Be patient - 10 minutes seems like an awfully long time, but you don始t get a progress bar like when you flash with assistant. Do not disconnect the drone when the script says its finished - thats only the upload portion!

To root, rename fireworks.tar dji_system.bin and re run the script as above. Power cycle the drone 2 minutes after running the script. DO NOT TURN OFF YET after the power cycle.

Now adb devices, and you should see the mavic listed. (RedHerring has Fangs!). adb shell into it and execute these two lines (use copy and paste, a typo = a brick!) in the shell:

mount -o remount,rw /system
echo /system/bin/adb_en.sh >> /system/bin/start_dji_system.sh
reboot

This makes the root permenant.

```
